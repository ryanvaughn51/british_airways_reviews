a320,family leisure,economy class,larnaca to london,1,2,1,1,2,,2,no,no attempt to provide fresh or hot foo,"just a few years ago flying on ba was enjoyable, but times have changed. these days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. the terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. on board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. ba’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. there is no entertainment, no magazine. refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? you get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. on the return flight, for one reason or another due to ba’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. the cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. altogether, i would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything i could recommend ba for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journeys.",3,2022-10-01

""thanks for contacting us about your claim for eu compensation. we're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to heathrow on 29 april 2022. your claim's been refused because ba0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason. further to your request, i would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund, as the same is looked after by our support team. we take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision. the cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule. thanks again for following this up with us. please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and i hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon. best regards british airways customer relations"". i don't know what ""non payable commercial reason"" is. i am out about 250 sterling, going to just leave it their and boycott this company.",1,2022-04-01

,solo leisure,economy class,new york to newcastle via london,3,4,4,4,1,,4,no,i said i wanted 20-25% back off my holiday,over the past 2 years i have flown with british airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in london heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to newcastle. while the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at heathrow are useless. first time in february 2020 i got stuck in heathrow due to storm ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. however the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. they had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. in the end after a 12 hour battle i was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when i finally spoke to someone. in november 2021 i decided to give ba a second chance and booked to go to new york. since the plane landed late into lhr i missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. as i rushed through customs i did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. my layover was now 10 hours and all i got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what i thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. a few days after i got home i then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed i was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. when i got a response i said i wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. i got an apology and told the staff at heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation i was offered nothing!,3,2021-11-01
boeing 737-800,couple leisure,business class,cape town to durban,3,2,3,,4,,3,yes,return trip was disappointing,"return trip cape town to durban in club class highlighted the inconsistency. our outbound trip in december was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. the lounge was busy, but no complaints. we went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. the informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. i checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in durban, and flown to cape town, port elizabeth, back to cape town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. in fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. the food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. with the price of good wines in south africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew",6,2022-01-01

,solo leisure,economy class,london to cairo,5,5,,,5,,4,yes,i do want to thank ba,"i was supposed to fly with aeroflot on the 23rd of december to moscow. but because russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and i couldn’t get home. i’ve also tried to fly through antalya, but the same situation occurred. on my third try, i came to heathrow and tried to fly away to cairo. i was declined by another company. then i went to british airways. starting from testing (because egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (i’m not sure is it connected to ba, but still, i want to mention this). the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this. i want to separately point out one employee - shanell (if i am not mistaken, who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal 5). she is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! carrying on, i went to ba check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. however, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. i’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. after i got my results i came back to heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to cairo, the situation became even more complicated (i will spare the details). however, here again, brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. the nicest lady i’ve ever met, unfortunately, i didn’t catch her name, but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i can’t thank her enough. she also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  lastly, the nice lady (shame i don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position. he was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways i can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. to conclude, i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, i honestly do not know what would i do if i haven’t met them. i don’t know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality, but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! for some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. however, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise. as no one in",10,2020-12-01

boeing 777-200,business,business class,las vegas to gatwick,2,2,2,4,4,,1,no,very disappointing service,"las vegas to gatwick. a very disappointing service for club world, it felt like i was travelling in economy (with attitude). especially considering the very high cost of the flight (i've paid half as much less for business class returns to australia). we got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). my initial drink after take off was not what i ordered, when i queried it, i got a lecture on this was how it should be. no wine arrived with dinner, until i asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. yes, i could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until i got up and went to the galley to ask. the good news is the food was good and well presented. although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (i later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). we had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, i actually thought i had a fever (i was so drenched in sweat) until i spoke to a colleague who was the same. i'm used to flying ultra long haul with middle eastern airlines, so i'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. no need to say anything much about the eight across seating as i know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. i do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. i have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. there is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. at no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general pa announcement. the seats i can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. really ba, you need to do much, much better. the ground staff in las vegas were fast, friendly and efficient. the lounge was something from the dark ages, all 1970's wooden panels.",3,2020-01-01
boeing 747-400,business,business class,san diego to stockholm via london,5,5,5,3,1,1,3,no,roller coaster of incompetence,"san diego to stockholm via london. had i written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. but i realise this would be unfair- ba is a game of two halves. the inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. the food in club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and ife absolutely fine. the club world product is competitive with the better european airlines such as lufthansa and streets ahead of most us carriers. the problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. in my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. then a comedy of errors. first the hotel vouchers just said ‘holiday inn’. there are about 15 in san diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. next, the replacement flights. the clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. eventually the full website on a pc showed my replacement flights. but no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. on calling ba they wouldn’t talk to me because i ‘failed’ security- i didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. the next day i went to take the replacement flights- alaska airlines to newark then sas to stockholm. despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, i was pulled off minutes before takeoff. ba had not paid for the flight! a reservation had been created but no ticket issued. ba then booked me on a roundabout route back via chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. later i spotted that the next ba flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was i not on this? when i called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after i complained about all of the above. finally, i arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. in summary, when all goes well, ba is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. but old planes, rubbish back office it infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong. and bear in mind i was travelling in business class- who knows how they treat economy passengers.",5,2020-01-01

boeing 737-800,family leisure,economy class,johannesburg or tambo to cape town,4,5,5,5,5,,5,yes,flight has improved my opinion on british airways,"johannesburg to cape town return. this flight was operated by comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal british airways flight in europe. check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i was flying business. johannesburg airport and cape town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. their lounge, called slow is actually impressive. although there was no full english on offer unlike the british airways galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. they even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. i assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. i would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. i reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. these seats were old and plush, however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft as those offer better support. i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. i did not expect this as business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. there were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. it was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. the crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. they were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. in cape town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. but since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. i think that this flight has improved my opinion on british airways, and they were the same price as the competition, south african airways. i would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africa's busiest air route. for the price paid, i'd be happy to fly them again.",8,2019-07-01

b737-400 / a380 / a319,couple leisure,business class,durban to leeds via johannesburg / heathrow,4,5,5,5,5,,5,yes,service on this flight was superb,"the connecting flight to johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. everything went smoothly and service was good. boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. much has been said about the ba ying-yang seat configuration. the seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. however the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the white company bedding is excellent. we had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. the centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. the service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. there was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. there could be no complaints in respect of catering. the a380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. our connecting flight to leeds was good, but compared with our south african flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. it is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. the only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in leeds. the airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen. there was only one other arrival, but we still waited over 30 minutes for luggage to come through.",10,2019-05-01

,solo leisure,business class,heathrow to singapore,3,3,2,4,3,,3,no,expected a better level of attention to detail,"i was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle. during the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. however, into the flight i found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. i was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and i needed to ask for a pillow. the menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. the evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was ok served with freezing cold cutlery. bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. the breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. the lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. overall i expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. the only business class addition feature that i appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. ba ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a qf 11 from singapore to brisbane, insisting i needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight. i am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for me. when i arrived in singapore, the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight.",4,2019-05-01

boeing 777-200,couple leisure,economy class,gatwick to barbados,3,1,2,4,3,,3,no,return flight extremely poor,"gatwick to barbados return. i normally travel on ba with low expectations with the result that i am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. the outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an ok cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. however, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in barbados before the virgin flight that was scheduled to leave gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. the return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of ba with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. the pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the pe cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). no bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so i presume it was missed. my wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. however, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. when they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. it also spilled on my kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. a very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and i suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. my wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. once again we landed on time, which was a good thing. overall, the return flight was extremely poor.",3,2019-05-01

""build value guys"" and the profits will follow. its the oldest dictum in the book. i will give credit where credit is due. on the way back, on the ground, the captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. as an aviation buff i loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. he picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. one or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. very nice chap. we took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine. fas in both directions were very good.",5,2019-03-01

boeing 777-200,couple leisure,first class,gatwick to barbados,2,5,2,2,3,,3,no,so much ba could do to improve,"gatwick to barbados. we flew out of gatwick on the 6th december and back on the 17th dec. it started well in the newish 1st class lounge at the south terminal. however, the walk to the gate is miles. it has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. the north terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. i'd guess ba got offered a cheaper deal to move to the s.t. my first impression was how badly the ""new"" 1st class is holding up. there are scuff marks everywhere. surface scratches. bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. it's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. in the wc there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. needs a paint job at least. the motley flowers (that ba removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. they looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. much has been said about the seat being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. it is not a true 1st class in the sense of what emirates and singapore airlines offer. (i have flown both in 1st). the food is also business class quality. more casual dining rather than fine dining. taking one meal; it starts with an amuse bouche. one motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. one tomato. one bit of green stuff. one straggly piece of prosciutto ham. total cost about 30p. outstanding! i then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. totally, utterly boring. my wife had the soup which she said was nice. i then had jerk chicken dish. it was just about okay. the glassware and chinaware was okay. the cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in pizza express, except the stuff in pizza express is better. i accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much ba could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. they trumpet the ""superb"" laurent perrier grand siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most airline 1st class offer in krug. £20 a bottle more! the alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang club business class. the world's most hated business class in the sky. i'm a businessman and i know i could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. from a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st flight as part of a ba holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish. the fas as always were a very nice bunch of men and women.",6,2018-12-01

(apparently 3 are loaded in london for the o/w leg but none for the return.) friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service. fast bar service followed by veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul. salty, dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables. the salad is a nonsense – a few leaves and a tomato slice. pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross. got a couple of hours sleep. however the ife froze after take off due to the pa system remaining locked on and preventing the ife from working. a reset halfway through the flight worked, though two loud renditions of delibe’s “flower duet” burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up. the standard t&cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing. i continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is. (ba should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) after leaving toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. for the return leg, i took the seasonal lgw to toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper. an upgrade to club world was a pleasant surprise. fast check in at lgw but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane. gatwick airport sell £5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with ba fast track customers. excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. efficient boarding and a great reception from the gatwick cabin crew. a fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. the gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from heathrow – more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. fast bar service once airborne, followed by the old biz food service. overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option. plenty of wine and drinks along with t&c. after a pleasant 3 hour nap, i woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues. at the gate early and fast bags too. this club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service. so new toiletries and bedding but the old menu. i hope gatwick catches up so ba don’t (unintentionally) promote two levels of biz service with lgw being the poor relative. on the o/w leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp. the food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as ba really lag behind air canada on this route with premium economy. i do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat. all that said, i felt that ba is regaining it’s mojo with great crew, improved on board experience (cuts reinstated) and on time performance. long may this improvement last!",8,2018-08-01

(and all over 25!) the meal was vile - overcooked, salty and dry. as the plane was empty, i went back to economy and had three hours sleep across three seats. awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese was served before landing. ife on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights at christmas! an early arrival and fast bags finished off a ok flight. returning, i liked the biz / first class check in area at lgw - fast and friendly. the lounge at gatwick was streets ahead of heathrow. self serve champagne and loads of seats. kept very clean and plenty of food. an upgrade to biz was nice on a full flight. efficient boarding and a fast coat / drink and menu service. a really fast bar service only 20 mins in, with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from heathrow. the only thing that spoilt it was off duty ba staff in biz, chatting (and distracting) the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying. an early arrival into toronto finished a near perfect flight, the gatwick 777s are old - very old with no power in premium economy. (currently going through a refurb progamme), but with efficient and friendly crew and on time / early performance - there was little to dislike, and i even liked gatwick!!",8,2018-06-01

a380,business,economy class,singapore to london,4,2,1,1,3,,4,no,ife is a work of mystery,"singapore to london. this was the second part of my sydney to london trip and looked forward to it as it was on a ba a380. now this aircraft, in qantas colours, is one i am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with qf. as mentioned in my review of ba16 (which was the first leg of this trip) it is the on board soft product that is the problem. the same comments for that review apply here. the ife is a work of mystery in terms of content. on qantas, american, cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies, great music choices. those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning (godfather, gladiator, brave-heart, roman holiday etc) are all things we as passengers want to see. some smart edgy team in soho, london pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff. ife is one thing on long haul. the other is food and beverage. the food quality was just substandard and something i read about constantly. on qantas (say qf1 from singapore to london) one gets the evening meal service, followed by weiss ice cream, a lindt chocolate along the way, midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc. at the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found, chocolates, banana bread, cheese and biscuits. you would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered. ba need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between. the a380 is a flagship aircraft and on qantas it is treated as such. i am a qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes. put the smartest, best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember. the ba crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls. one guy looked like steptoe (for those who remember) and was a miserable. flying on an a380 should be an experience and i enjoy all my trips on that aircraft. ba have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another. that is sad given the stature of ba. i came back on ba31 from london to hong kong and the same comments apply. hard product is fine (except for no snack bar) but the soft product is lacking severely.",4,2018-05-01

boeing 747-400,business,economy class,vancouver to edinburgh via london,2,2,3,2,1,,2,no,the worst travel experience,"vancouver to edinburgh via london was the worst travel experience i have had. i was travelling with 2 seniors (+85 & +70) we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving. we actually had to beg for help. the distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors. in our way from london to edinburgh it was a nightmare. the flight was delayed and we got to london about an hour late, on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care. the 2 seniors had to walk all that way. it was not only the walking, it was the rush they had, as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 1:30 hours. on our way back from inverness to canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance. once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate. again we had to beg for assistance and the british airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. they said that they called the buggy and that was all. we said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates/ terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all. we were lucky i asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 (in london) and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point. this gentleman who is not british airways employee provided a great service. summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance i asked and he decided to help us out. seats were another problem. we did the online check in (24 before) and we had the seats already chosen 12d for one senior (isle) and 18d (isle) for the other senior. when we got to the counter in inverness airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats. then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats. so once again, more walking for them, problems to get in/out the seats, and of course problem to get to the washroom. - luggage another problem! british airways in inverness said that the luggage goes directly to victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in vancouver. surprise surprise! we went through customs and when we got to westjet counter for the connection to victoria they asked for the luggage.  they said we had to pick it up before going through customs. there was no way to go back to the carousel, so we had to wait for the westjet staff to contact somebody from british airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. so nightmare again!! and another rush to us to get to the next fligh. according to westhet agents they said that british airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection. what can you expect from british airways? if it doesn’t even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance. we can only thank westjet staff who provide the assistance in vancouver.",3,2017-12-01

boeing 777-200,solo leisure,business class,london to tel aviv,5,4,4,1,4,1,5,yes,was a very enjoyable flight,"london to tel aviv. arrived at heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy, but check and security felt like it was 10pm, very easy and quick process (which included regular rather than fast track security as we didn’t follow the signs properly). we used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor, although they did later improve. the food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches, soup and some dry cake. this wasn’t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty. drinks overall were good as always with british airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling. in terms of seating, there was enough for all the passengers in there, and it was quite busy, and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place, although better variety in seating, including some more comfortable chairs, would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising. this biggest failing was the staff in the lounge, which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges. smiles are free and go a long way, and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality, eerily walking around slightly like a zombie, seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd! the other area which i find completely below standard are the toilets. whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc, the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room. the regular heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality. whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice, there aren’t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier. on board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin. this meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access. these seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort, privacy and access. unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife, which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution, selection and even the fact that some screens won’t even stay in place and fold themselves away! british airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft, end of story! even the thales system is showing its age now, but this rockwell collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art! the cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience. some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc, and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly. others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience. food and drinks on board were actually quite good, although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet. overall it was a very enjoyable flight, and as i booked using avios and a companion voucher it was exceptional value for money. having said that, i would have still considered it good value even if paying cash.",7,2017-11-01

(we had three checked bags instead of 2 and british airways only allows one checked bag or you pay close to $100 for additional). luckily the gentlemen at the counter checked the bag at no charge. i can't say the same for the rest of our trip. we found that the flight was full and they had not placed our seats together for a 6.5 hr flight and we had 2 middle seats. the neighbors on our flight refused to swap seats, originally then after some pity complaining a lovely woman swapped. we arrived into london around 9am. late of course, and after running to the next terminal in an attempt to make our connection, we missed our flight and were unable to make it through security. the ba representative told us the next flight was full and we would have to wait until 5pm. we again explained that we were on our honeymoon and had afternoon ticket reservations in rome. the ba representative was then able to find two seats on a 12pm flight - so we missed our ticket reservations but were able to get into rome for dinner. upon our return flights, we attempted three times to reserve seats online via british airways app and web (learning from before) and the website kept giving us an error screen even though the charge was pending on my paypal account. we eventually had to make an international call and pay $174 to ensure we were able to sit next to each other on the 8 hr flight home, though we could not select seats for our connecting flight to london. once we arrived at rome to check - we got hit with the $100 additional baggage fee (we we tried to explain, the representative refused to comp the bag). upon arriving at the gate my ticket was pinged for having an extra bag that was not paid for. luckily, we had the receipt from paying 2 hrs earlier. otherwise i imagine we would've had to shell out $100 again. we are crossing our fingers for a safe trip home, as we are again delayed on our flight from rome to london. if you fly british airways prepare to be nickled and dimed at every part of your journey.",1,2017-11-01

(we had already paid $10,328.26 for these tickets). 3. disembark the ship and take our chances with chinese immigration. option 2 was outrageous, option 3 frightening. we felt we had no choice but to choose option 1. the travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at check-in and request our business class seats if they were available. when we checked in at pvg we asked if there were business class seats available. “yes, several” was the response. we explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats. “yes, for a cost of $12,776 “. of course we refused to pay that amount. we were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class, two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy. while on board during that flight ba160, i went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats. when we arrived in london we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats. were we on the same flight as originally scheduled, but i was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers. apparently british airways sold our seats or an upgrade to other passengers at our expense.",1,2017-10-01

boeing 747-400,couple leisure,business class,gatwick to orlando,3,2,4,2,3,,3,no,depths to which ba have descended,"gatwick to orlando return. worst ever long-haul business class flight.  we have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which british airways have descended (not the world’s favourite airline by far). we have never liked ba’s business class (club world) seats since they changed over to the yin-yang layout of 8 seats across the cabin. the seat layout together with the poor service, meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever long-haul business class flight we have experienced. to this day i have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the caa regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place. unless you are sat in an aisle seat, cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks/meals which is just ridiculous. (true this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head!) in order to get out of the centre seats (rows e and f) and the window seats you have to climb over another passenger’s feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined. in the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous; as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over. we are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason. you almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly, often from behind you so by the time you notice them, they have gone. we should not have to use a call button just to get basic service. the return leg was a night flight, the service overall was very poor, the crew just wanted to turn the lights down asap. the service at breakfast was also poor, the offerings were inconsistent. my wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin, whereas i at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee. the entertainment system was archaic (very few recent film titles), the small screen resolution was very poor; this aircraft was delivered to ba in march 1999 and it shows its age. this flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service. ba are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them. it is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats, you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service. it will be marginally better than being seated at the back; but that does not make it right. we will probably never fly ba long-haul business class (club world) again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and re-configure their seating!",3,2017-09-01

a321,couple leisure,economy class,london heathrow to istanbul,2,1,1,,2,,1,no,is quite clearly in decline,"london heathrow to istanbul. british airways is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for its customers, even loyal ones who have status like myself. the overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airline. galleries south in t5 is large, airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the sunday i travelled. drinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offers - the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredients. onboard it is similarly tired, the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table. seating is cramped. the cabin crew look dejected and have low morale. onboard experience the service is no different, than flying easyjet, in fact i would argue worse. there is no complimentary catering, you are subjected to m&s sandwiches. it is not cheap and or good value or any better than lcc offerings. service is slow and took the whole of 4.5 hours of the flight - meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle - i was even asked to wait until i was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people. the slow service is due to the use of card only payment, and also the fact the supplier doesn't allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down. on the return journey its clear ba doesn't care about its european or non-north american routes - the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar, in fact it was dark dingy and furniture filthy, but least the food was decent. overall if it wasn't for the fact i flew with ff miles and the low tax on redemptions within europe, i would never actually pay the full cash fare for this airline - you get better more efficient service on the likes of easyjet now within europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed.",2,2017-08-01

(the coffee, by the way, was excellent). the return flight was worse because the trolley made it two thirds down the aisle and was getting tantalisingly close to me before abruptly stopping and returning to the galley, leaving the remaining passengers unserved. in conclusion, clean plane, punctual service, pleasant cabin crew but awful refreshment service.",8,2017-09-01

,couple leisure,business class,naples to gatwick,4,3,4,,3,,2,no,am soon likely to hate it,"naples to gatwick. i used to admire and love ba. i now no longer admire it but dislike it and am soon likely to hate it. i think that one is entitled to have pleasant expectations when paying the not inconsiderable supplement for flying club europe. my wife and i have noticed a constant deterioration over the last two years, have complained (and received some avios in compensation) but, this time, the cup overfloweth, unfortunately not with blessings. we had, once again (!) been allocated aisle seats in separate rows even though my wife’s preference states that she likes a window seat – and there were plenty of seats adjacent to each other available when we were permitted to make online changes so we did manage to get seats next to each other – but why does ba have to keep doing this? the trip as such started well enough in the new ba south terminal lounge, which was spacious and had a good selection of drinks, food and magazines. when time came for boarding and, amongst others, club europe passengers were invited to board first, there was no check made at all, which resulted in an almighty scrum as just anybody pushed forward immediately, exacerbated by then having to stand cooped up in the stifling bridge for over 10 minutes as the cleaning of the aircraft had not finished. once boarded, we were – unlike the other club europe passengers – not offered a glass of water but, worst of all (and unforgivable) found food debris and other dirt in between our seats (so much for having to wait for the cleaning to be finished). when i opened my meal tray, it clearly had not been cleaned as there were crumbs and stains on it. we took photographs and also pointed our findings out to the very pleasant stewardess, who seemed utterly appalled when she looked. the meal was pleasant but we were not offered coffee or tea afterwards. and whilst i do not object to being served wine from a large bottle, it means one gets only a (smallish) glassful so has to ask for a refill, something not everybody likes to do. this practice of pouring from a large bottle is clearly a cost-cutting exercise. on previous occasions we had been disappointed to find that no lounge facilities for club europe passengers are available in airports like corfu, rhodes, heraklion, even seville (contrary to ba’s website at the time – we were told at all these airports ‘ ba no longer pays for its passengers to have access’) so, this time, my wife enquired well in advance whether we would have lounge access in naples. she was told no; but at least, we knew beforehand – or so we thought, but when we got the holding area prior to the gate opening, we were joined by some rather merry club europe passengers who told us that there was a lounge (though not exclusively for ba use) that they had been able to access and enjoy! why could the check-in staff not have told us? the waiting area did not have sufficient seats but we were lucky and found some. however, when a young lady arrived to deal with checking boarding cards, passengers who were sitting beyond where she stood, were forced to get up and move all the way back to the other side. club europe passengers were amongst the first to be called, so that did not look too bad. know what? we showed our boarding pass, then had to stand (no seats available) in a very cramped area for 14 minutes before the gate was opened. in other words, we had the doubtful privilege of having to stand for longer than other passengers.",2,2017-07-01

(used to be only ex london). fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer. an ok chicken curry was served but i still don't see it as biz class food. a choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each. that is where the improvements ended. the morning offering of a cereal bar and t&cs / juice remains an insult and just shows how little ba care about the entire journey customer experience. the crew on this flight were great. young, junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional. a request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi, but appeared (in glass) without asking as soon as the crew were released - classy and well remembered! the return flight was less good. drinks served promptly after take off and my pre-booked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray. (crew member's first flight since qualifying) it took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a wtp tray. the underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and t&c. customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back (really) as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers. this cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours i need something more substantial than chocolate. service reduced - yes, price reduced - no! the 777's in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of wtp, the ife screens are tiny. mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort. however, the male crew were more aloof, lacked attention to detail and officious. what these (newer) crews miss, was the more informal / laid back service of long haul crew - i hope they relax into the role soon! at least the cuts have stopped (not much left to cut i admit) and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show ba have listened. however, the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast us / canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey. the jury remains out on whether i continue my loyalty to ba and one world - it really depends on what ba do next - to either value me as a customer (and offer a quality service) or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline (at which point - i'm off).",7,2017-05-01

boeing 777-200,couple leisure,business class,antigua to gatwick,3,2,2,2,4,,3,no,overall very disappointing,"antigua to gatwick. check in at the new terminal was quick and efficient (better than gatwick) and although we had a slight delay at immigration, we were soon airside. the new lounge was really comfortable and although we didn't use it (it was dark when we were there) they have an excellent sky terrace with loungers and shaded sofa's etc. the bar was manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of food. boarding was on time. on board it was soon evident that the interior of the plane had seen better days with my wife's tv nearly falling off its mounting. fortunately she was able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it was quite precarious. push back and departure was exactly on time. within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange. unlike the flight out, where there was a more relaxed atmosphere, the crew seemed to feel there was a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some of them were literally running down the aisles. the food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tasteless. i can only assume that the object of their haste was to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down as quickly as possible. to be quite honest i felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and i almost expected them to say 'i want you to go to sleep now and i don't want to here a sound out any of you until the morning'! now i know that the crew are all entitled to their breaks etc, but at the end of the day (or night) they are working and are getting paid to do so. in my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passengers, it would improve the flight considerably. breakfast was ok although i seemed to be the only person trying the bacon rolls and after one mouthful i understood why. in a blind tasting i probably would have guessed i was eating rubber bands. we arrived on time and after quite a long walk to immigration and the baggage reclaim, our cases were waiting for us. overall very disappointing and based on this flight i would not recommend ba.",3,2017-05-01

""only two were loaded"", was the reply. ""what; two only, for the whole of club?"". ""yes"". i asked what else was on board, only to be told that i would have to pay £3 for an m & s sandwich from economy. before some help from our avios, the tickets cost £500.00. it was beyond belief that an executive card holder should be treated this way. the (very nice) cabin crew were excruciatingly embarrassed. ba should wake up before once loyal passengers swallow hard (pun) and migrate to other carriers. i'd rather fly easyjet and spend the £300 change on a nice meal.",1,2017-03-01

(hint for frequent flyers: if your card just doesn't work you get your food and drink for free.) meanwhile, behind the service trolley, a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves (a very appropriate expression in the circumstances). other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier: several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and m&s extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight. whoever at british airways is employed to read reviews on this website, please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare. the process i call 'ryanisation' of british airways is almost complete. you now charge for checked baggage (yes, i know that's indirect, but only idiots can't see through the scam), you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall, and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats, and now you've devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on 'short haul' (what even ba used to call 'medium haul') flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane. oh, and by the way: why don't the cabin crew deploy the a320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress? too costly, perhaps? i suggest that ba needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan, but with a minor revision: ""british airways, the world's least favourite airline"".",1,2017-04-01
,solo leisure,economy class,london heathrow to rome,1,1,1,,1,,2,no,can no longer live on past reputation,"having only flown easyjet / ryanair for all my short-haul journeys over the last 10 years or so, i was pleased to see a relatively low-cost ba flight for my round trip from london to rome. in hindsight, i wish i'd booked a different airline and not booked ba based on its legacy reputation. to say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatement. i expected, at the very least, an equivalent service to that of other low-cost short-haul airlines, certainly not worse. narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm. regardless of this, there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable. even on a 2.5hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that, at a relatively small 5""8, my knees were grazing the seat in front. lucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worse. i was also tantalised by the ba bragging of m&s supplied food. i am more than happy to pay for this on a short-haul flight and don't expect anything for free. it certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptions. sadly, being sat in row 22, this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything. no sandwiches, no fruit salad, no yoghurt. i asked what they did have. their response 'bottle of water or a kit kat'. after asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least. 'they never give us enough food. it's mad. they give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight'. needless to say that ba can no longer live on their past reputation. they had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the low-cost carriers. sadly, they probably sit about 4th or 5th down the list. i'd say i'd give their long-haul a chance but after this experience, i won't bother. what a shame.",1,2017-04-01

(i asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine - wouldn't recommend you do the same). the 'card-only' payment system is chaos as well, it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other. next on the list is the outrageous prices that ba charge to select a seat in advance. not wishing to pay this, by the time i checked in for this flight (the maximum 24 hours in advance) there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane i could choose from. i took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane, which is far from my first choice of seat. other carriers let you select seats at check-in for free, and easyjet charge about half of what ba charge to select the equivalent seats in advance (and if you pick one of the 'preferred' seats with easyjet, you also get priority check-in and boarding for your money - not so with ba). check-in at t5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check-in machine wouldn't work at all, and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn't let me print a bag tag. so i couldn't use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check-in desks, wasting time. there was a minor delay due to fog, but that wasn't ba's fault and didn't have a hige impact. flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good. on the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real 'pro' to flying ba in europe with standard economy fares - the ability to switch between flights for free on-the-day. could we? no, the earlier flight was full. rather than sit in munich airport all afternoon, we rebooked on lufthansa instead. in summary, if flying ba on european routes these days, be aware that ba is now a no-frills carrier. lower your expectations to this level, and you'll probably have a pleasant flight.",5,2017-03-01

(more like economy food). afternoon tea was fine, with a fast deplaning and bags. on the long haul legs, the ife was identical to christmas, poor choice, little new material - clearly even the ife is now down graded. the biz class product - once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy. how the mighty have fallen! experiencing four classes on four legs, showed the gulf in all classes between ba and competitors on both short and long haul. the short haul legs to / from berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what you're getting and it's reflected in the fare and extras. with less leg room, fewer toilets, reduced quality and/or no refreshments, and a general downgrading of service, the only thing not reduced is the price. this suggests that the ba exec and iag only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline. the only thing left to strip customers of is the exec club and avios. it's only a matter of time before this final nail in the ba coffin hits the customer at which point - i'm off! hello star alliance!",4,2017-03-01

""lunch"" was a mars bar or similar. i did not bother with the ""buy on board"" stuff on the flight to edinburgh - i get a better choice in the terminal when i get off the aircraft. the domestic flight back from edinburgh to heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew i have ever seen on ba, giggling at each other during the safety demonstration - very unprofessional. the evening meal out of london back to kuwait was more like a snack, with a smallish steak, three snap peas, three baby carrots (i counted the things), and another babyfood potato thing. ""breakfast"" was a muesli bar. sorry guys: a comment on this board that ba equals ""budget airline"" just about sums it all up. i have other choices from the gulf back home, and next time i will be thinking about taking one of them: the only attraction with ba is the extra legroom in premium economy, the choice of entertainment, and the direct flight to heathrow rather than having to fly down the gulf and return. otherwise, the epitaph ""how the mighty have fallen"" springs to mind.",7,2017-02-01

""we can't give you a boarding pass - its not a ba partnered airline"" - ""but ba did all the booking!"". blank look and total non-helpfulness. ""try in heathrow"". i eventually phoned and got the pnr and checked myself in with a boarding pass. similarly on the way back, there was no instruction to the point that ba wanted me to confirm my bags in mumbai before getting on the lhr flight. when i got to the gate, the ba staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my bags. the fact that no-one told me to do so seemed to be lost on them. essentially despite ba being the travel agent here, it seems to be all the customers responsibility to know what to do. the flights out were not too bad - fairly empty business class, and staff were accordingly attentive, aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choice. on the way back - forget it. firstly - no overhead luggage space because it was filled with ba stuff - it wasn't the 'for airline use only' at the front - it was row 11! when i asked them to shift that, i was met with resentful suggestions that i could find space elsewhere on the plane. i was pretty firm but polite on the point that having paid for business class, i did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat - and that i wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead baggage space. done with bad grace. they then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight - an overnight request for a cup of tea (i skipped dinner to sleep) took 20 mins. the breakfast was truly awful - one of the worst airline meals i have ever had. the seats are tight - i endorse all the concerns of the 2-4-2 configuration. i'm 6 ft 5, but keep myself fit and i'm not fat. i have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the ba version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable. yes, its flat - but its short, and tight, and lumpy! lufthansa, ethihad, emirates, singapore, eva, thai, cathay pacific - all do much better than this - even delta and american airlines internationals are much better. generally, the ba experience is unhelpful, uncomfortable and shabby. i'm embarrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre services. its not because they are so much cheaper than others. finally, i'm now sitting in one of the ba lounges at terminal 5, and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns, porridge, and muesli. what happened to the cooked breakfasts they offered four years ago?

a320,business,economy class,lisbon to london,2,2,,,3,,2,no,rebrand to a budget airline,"lisbon to london heathrow. now that ba have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flights, they might as well rebrand to a budget airline. over the last few years, leg room across european flights (business and economy class) has decreased, to the point where it now practically the same as any budget airline. that said, it is in practice worse than budget airlines, because at least the main budget carriers have done the decent thing of removing the seat recline button, eliminating further discomfort. even without the seat in front reclined, anyone taller than 5' 8"" will be packed in tightly on any european short-haul flight. the staff are friendly and polite. however, they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinks/food sales service, especially when the plane is full and the flight is under 2hours 30mins. this does not only result in thirsty / hungry customers, but also the almost permanent presence of the service trolleys in the aisle blocking access to the toilets. business class (which i sometimes use) is offered a free meal and drinks, all of a reasonable quality. however, in terms of legroom / seat size there is no benefit compared to economy. the only reason i continue to fly ba is because i have fairly set routes and ba generally fly at times which suit me. otherwise, i get little in the way of added value. the benefits of avios points and moving up membership tiers are hardly worth it (in monetary terms), particularly if one mostly flies within europe. it is much cheaper to get a lounge membership (many are valid for most european - and beyond - airports), rather than remain loyal to ba these days. i have been flying with ba for well over a decade now, on a monthly basis. my sympathies go to the staff, because i fear cost-cutting will get them next, which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standards the crews maintain to this day.",2,2017-02-01

""cutbacks"". luckily i had a packet of shortbread (as a gift for friends in usa). at 1830 cabin service (tea) started. when i asked for daughter's pre-ordered child's meal, conversation with stewardess went thus - ""why didn't you order one?"" ""i did!"" ""she didn't have a child's meal at lunch"" ""yes, she did!"" ""oh well, i'll check when i've finished serving the main cabin"" really? we were only in the 3rd or 4th row - would it have been too much effort to check then? clearly yes it would. and when she did check some 20 minutes later, there was no child's meal - so they cobbled together a few bits from an unused child's lunch, very ungraciously. no hint of an apology. customer service? customer satisfaction? result: continued loyalty for transatlantic flights? what do you think?",3,2016-12-01

'sorry sir, the plane is now closed'. 'so you sold my ticket on'. 'no sir, but the plane is closed'. 'it cant be closed, there is plenty of time'. 'yes, but there are no seats'. i debated the point. 'i wouldn't debate the point sir, a lot of people have been pushed off flights today, and hotels in london are being booked out, if i were you i would jump on the internet and find accommodation'. because of course it was now my problem to find a hotel room in london (ba cover rooms up to £200, fine, though if you have kids they give you a mere £12.50 to cover breakfast, lunch and dinner for each child - in london, good luck). get a hotel, arrive back at the airport the next day, wait in line for 2 hours (luckily i arrived 3 hours early for domestic flight), get to the check in desk. guess what, i am booked on the flight but it appears my seat has been given away. again, of course, its my problem. 'go to the special management desk sir'. at that desk they tell me it could be today i get home, it could be tomorrow, but its hard to say, given the xmas period. but all in super surly tone, and it was clear this was all my fault. 'you can try another airline sir but they are all booked out' (at this stage i began checking car rentals and ferry times). absolutely disgusting attitude. every other airline i have dealt with, in these type of situations, booked me a hotel, and had a bus waiting or a taxi, with a return boarding pass for the next day. its a shame, as the cabin crew and pilots seem top notch. a team that is utterly let down by corporate, with their weak organisation and poor customer care policies. so i would love to fly ba for the crew and pilots, but given their utterly terrible customer care, its just not worth it.",2,2016-12-01

boeing 747-400,solo leisure,first class,lhr to sfo,3,3,3,3,2,,3,no,always hit and mostly miss,"london heathrow to san francisco with british airways. ba was once a classy airline for their first class service, amenities and food. but they have succumbed to the economic pressures to the point their first class service is a lot less than it use to but the price is still absurd even using points. they even hijack you for an additional $1000. or as i like to say, you cough up 200k in points and the $1000 fee covers their real expense for you to sit in first. they have jammed more seats in so the attendants have more customers. the seat in spite of its new design is tighter and less comfortable for a 6'1"", 240 person to do anything but sit up and watch a movie or hope they do not run out of the food selection on the menu. second, the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendants but the last two times i flew ba in first i had young attendants who clearly were not use to serving fc customers. a request for say an additional pillow or second cup of coffee went unanswered more than once which is a sign of inexperience. the last trip flying home in april i was handed a menu with a tasting menu or a traditional menu. first class was maybe 50% full. when it was my turn, i asked the flight attendant if i could select some of the tasting menu along with features from the traditional menu - she said she would check and shortly returned to say they were out of the tasting menu items. now please explain to me how any international first class service could be out of food 10 minutes after leaving the airport? clearly if they do not have enough for mix or matching then this is a stingy sign of cutbacks on the lowest scale to save a few pennies. at the average price of $10,000 for a first class seat, ba should make damn sure first class has all the food you need. their menu also talks about late night snacks and on the last two ba first class flights to the us when i wanted to try these snacks they were gone as they are shared with business class. the food served is both uninspiring and generally on the level of us airlines first class which is cooked to death and reheated. way to go ba, you have sunk to the lowest common denominator. third, when i arrive in sf and in spite of my luggage having a priority tag, it never comes out in the first batch and often towards the end of the delivery so they have failed on even that count. unlike the first class asian carriers like singapore and cathay where my fc luggage arrives first, ba is always hit and mostly miss. finally, what galls me is the worthless survey they ask me to fill out describing my fc experience on ba. i let them know everything i said in this review and the last question asked is ""would you like us to call you regarding this review and experience""? yes, i say and not once has someone called. i am waiting for the day when ba announces ""all passengers including first"" should buy food before boarding and headsets are for sale.",7,2016-04-01

(seeing a theme here) and so cheese was fetched from club. afternoon tea sandwiches were dry and bland. in the race to the bottom, ba continue to cut service - especially on the food front. i don't find it acceptable in first class for something as simple as cheese to run out with club food being substituted. this may save money (and wasted food) but the crew whilst cheerfully making the best of a bad job are not being given the food or or product to deliver first class service. in fact, the crew were the only saving grace. ba don't seem to get it. even in premium cabins, they continue to downgrade service to save money and gain an even worse reputation as the uk's flag carrier. biz and first class products are dropping at an alarming rate. wake up ba and iag - before it's too late.",7,2016-11-01

,family leisure,economy class,bcn to lhr,2,2,2,1,1,,4,no,it was beyond ridiculous,"barcelona to london. has anyone ever been told to bring marriage certificate while traveling abroad to spain? according to a british airways gate agent at barcelona airport, i supposed to have my marriage certificate with me in order to get on the airplane and leave spain. i drove across the border from the states to meet a friend in canada and flew out from vancouver on the same day to london for a week, and then from london to spain for two weeks. all along the way of going through customs of canada, uk, and spain, i was granted entries without been questioned till the last day of my vacation when i was leaving spain. all of a sudden, this gate agent asked me “where are you going?  where do you live?  are you traveling alone?” i thought she was rather friendly until she pulled me aside from the gate and tell me “you have to wait here, i need to talk to someone.” there were at least over 50 people behind me waiting and trying to figure out why i cannot get on the airplane.  i am a permanent resident of us; however, i am a citizen of the country participates in visa waver program, which means i don’t need visa to enter spain and definitely not when i leave. so, what’s wrong!? my name on the boarding pass and passport are matching but the name on my us permanent resident card does not match with my passport. of course, i just got married so that i have different last name from my passport, but even that, what kind of right does she have to ask me for my us permanent resident card and stop me at the gate like that?! so, when she asked me if i have any documentation to clarify the mismatch of my last name, i jokingly answered “marriage certificate??” next thing i know was i cannot get on the airplane because i didn’t have marriage certificate with me, and what made it even funnier was after she spoke to someone, she said to me ""you can go this time but next time you will have to have marriage certificate with you."" it was beyond ridiculous!",3,2016-11-01

(i should have explained that medoc is a bordeaux region, but really). this simply comes nowhere close to thai, emirates or cathay. singapore airlines is in a league way way ahead. i should add that the lounges in paris and london were great. paris was a share with cathay, and london's terminal 5 lounge was excellent. shame about the flight and the quite hideous seating: tight, face to face with a complete stranger, noisy and hard.",3,2016-09-01

,couple leisure,economy class,las to lhr,1,1,4,2,2,,3,no,did not have a good experience,"las vegas to london heathrow return, and we did not have a good experience with british airways. both flights were incredibly hot and stuffy, unlike anything i've ever experienced flying on any other airline. i tend to run cold and usually need a sweater on planes, but i was uncomfortably hot the whole time. my husband and some of the other passengers sitting near me also commented on how stuffy it was. the staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few. i definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline, and if you're a have not then don't even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff. the people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them. on our return flight, we asked about paying to upgrade our seats but were told it was a full flight and we wouldn't be able to because some passengers were receiving complimentary upgrades and others were being downgraded. i thought it was odd that they would be giving free upgrades if it meant downgrading passengers who had paid for better seats, but what was even more odd was that some passengers didn't know they'd been downgraded until they got on the plane! a group of passengers got on the plane and went to their seats only to find that they weren't the economy plus seats they'd paid for and reserved - they were regular coach seats. they had all the paperwork showing that they'd paid for economy plus, so this wasn't an error on their part. they were told it was a full flight and they could get off the plane if they wanted. a couple of passengers in this group were elderly and had paid for economy plus because an elderly lady in the group had a medical condition with her blood circulation so she needed the extra leg room. this poor old lady had to spend at least half the 10 hour flight standing in the aisle. the boarding process in las vegas was smooth, but boarding at heathrow was a joke. the staff only made one announcement, and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible. as a result, no one knew where they were supposed to go and people were standing in the wrong lines and basically all over the place. it made boarding take forever. the entertainment selection was sub par for such a long flight. a few decent movies but not much else. i thought the food was decent and they served plenty of food and drinks for the flight.",3,2016-06-01

boeing 777,solo leisure,premium economy,heathrow (london) to jfk (new york city),4,3,4,3,3,,4,yes,the seat was roomy,"i recently got an unexpected upgrade to world traveller plus whilst on my way to new york. there was free cava before take-off and a random hot towel handed out. the seat was roomy and leg room was fantastic. even more so because i was at the front of the world traveller plus cabin just after club world, so there were no seats in front of me. inflight entertainment was ok, but not as good as i was expecting. i did struggle to find things that interested me to watch as the choice was quite limited. i think now with early digital release of many films on things like i-tunes, the days of being able to see really recent films on aircraft before they become more widely available are coming to an end. as i was at the front of the cabin i had a screen that folded out of my armrest, which meant i was looking down at the screen instead of straight ahead, which gave me a bit of a neck ache after awhile. it was also annoying to stow away. the food was good for airline food. you get a superior meal in world traveller plus and it was pretty tasty and filling. the pre-landing snack wasn't up to much though. it was a dull sandwich, much like those that ba hand out on short-haul european flights. a real bonus about being in world traveller plus is that you're closer to the front of the plane and the exit. this is useful when arriving in the us where immigration queues can sometimes be exceptionally long. i ended up being close to the front of the immigration queue as i was so quick off the plane, which meant i was out through immigration pretty quickly. i think to pay for world traveller plus would be quite expensive for what you get in some respects (essentially a nicer meal and more leg room) but it was a nice treat from ba and if you were going on a super long haul flight i can definitely see the attraction.",8,2015-10-01
